Find out which Spotify hipsters you and your friends both like.

## Usage

1. Authorize Hipsterfy to access your Spotify account.
2. Hipsterfy generates a "friend code" for you.
3. Share your "friend code" with your friends.
4. Enter someone else's friend code to see the artists you both like, ordered by least-popular-first.

Your liked artists are a combination of artists you've followed, artists of tracks you've saved, and artists of albums you've saved.
